Description: The concordance index (CI) is a widely used to assess the 
    predictive value of biomedical assays. CI has previously been used in 
    cell line-based drug screening to estimate the probability that two 
    randomly-chosen cell lines are ranked identically across biological replicates 
    or independent studies based on their drug response. However, the conventional 
    formulation of CI does not account for the high level noise in drug response 
    measurements. Here we introduce the mCI package implementing a modification 
    of the concordance index (CI), called the robust concordance index (rCI) to 
    explicitly accounts for the intrinsic variability of the pharmacological assays. 
    For more details please see the included documentation.
