Description: The concordance index (CI) is a widely used to assess the 
    predictive value of biomedical assays. CI has previously been used in 
    cell line-based drug screening to estimate the probability that two 
    randomly-chosen cell lines are ranked identically across biological 
    replicates or independent studies based on their drug response. However, the 
    conventional formulation of CI does not account for the high level noise in 
    drug response measurements. Here we introduce the wCI package implementing a
    modification of the concordance index (CI), called the robust concordance 
    index (rCI) to explicitly accounts for the intrinsic variability of the 
    pharmacological assays. For more details please see the included 
    documentation.
